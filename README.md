Habibi Carpooling is a project created by four Ontario Tech University students: Sameer Karodia, Zaid Mostafa, Ajay Ramsaran & Muhammad Saad.
This project is intended to promote carpooling, and slow down the CO2 crisis.

POSTING A RIDE:
  If you are driving somewhere, and you have extra seats in your car you should post your ride to Habibi Carpooling. If more people in your area have a similar trip they can join your ride and contact you.
  When contacted you can establish gas payment, car rules, etc.

FINDING/JOINING A RIDE:
  Users can search for rides by destination, origin, time, etc. If they find a suitable ride, they can join it and contact the driver to establish gas payment, car rules, etc.
